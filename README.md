The aeolusNative module is an Android module allowing to integrate the C++ Aeolus library functions into an Android app.



This module contains git submodules which need to be initialized recursively. In addition, it depends on a separate Android Library module, 

namely the "midiBase" module. It is expected that in an app using aeolusNative, the midiBase module be installed side-by-side with the aeolusNative module.

The midiBase module is available at https://github.com/tbgitoo/midiBase
